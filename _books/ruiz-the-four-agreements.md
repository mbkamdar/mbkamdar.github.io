I found the essential message of the book compelling enough - it's a "classic" in these circles & is quite a short, quick read. I am not a fan of the type of spiritual writing in places & it's mostly a rehash of typical New Thought ideas. While it's a quick read, it could also have been half the length. However, for someone not yet introduced to these concepts in such a manner, I would recommend it.

A couple of sample excerpts:

> It is very interesting how the human mind works. We have the need to justify everything, to explain and understand everything, in order to feel safe. We have millions of questions that need answers because there are so many things that the reasoning mind cannot explain. It is not important if the answer is correct; just the answer itself makes us feel safe. This is why we make assumptions.

> Action is about living fully. Inaction is the way that we deny life. Inaction is sitting in front of the television every day for years because you are afraid to be alive and to take the risk of expressing what you are. Expressing what you are is taking action. You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action. Without action upon an idea, there will be no manifestation, no results, and no reward."

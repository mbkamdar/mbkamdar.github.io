The six core competencies are:
1. Concept
2. Character
3. Theme
4. Structure
5. Scene Execution
6. Writing Voice

A story, at its most elemntal level is:

After a hook and a setup the hero begins a quest, the pursuit of a need or a solution, from which springs a specific goal (survival, revenge, happiness, health, peace, wealth, justice, etc.), and then must square off with and ultimately conquer (or not) obstacles—this being the most critical element of storytelling: conflict. You then toss in a few inner demons as well as some exterior antagonistic forces, giving the hero something to battle and outwit and conquer as he strives to reach his goal.

## 1 - Concept

A concept is something that asks a question. The answer to the question is your story.

Differences between idea, concept and premise.

A non-story example: An idea is to travel to Florida. A concept is to travel by car and stop at all the national parks along the way. A premise is to take your estranged father with you and mend fences while on the road.

An idea would be to write a story about raising the Titanic from the bottom on the sea. A great idea. A concept would be to suggest that there are secrets still hidden there that certain forces would kill to keep concealed. A premise would be to create an archetypical hero who is hired to do this job and in doing so saves his country from potential attack.

The idea to write a story about ballet dancers is not a concept. It is just an idea. But when you add a forward-thinking realm to that idea, and do it in the form of a question—what if a ballet dancer loses her leg at the knee but perseveres against great prejudice to become a professional dancer?—you have evolved the idea into the realm of conceptualization.

Alice Sebold in The Lovely Bones: Her idea was to tell us a story that shows us what heaven is like. Her concept was to create a narrator for the story who was already in heaven, narrating the tale directly from heaven, and then turning it into a murder mystery.... Sebold’s concept, then, could be expressed as a question that demands an answer: What if a murder victim can’t rest in heaven because her crime remains unsolved, and chooses to get involved to help her loved ones gain closure?

A premise is a concept that has brought character into the mix. As such, it could be said that a premise is, in fact, an expanded concept. “What if the narrator of a story spoke to us from heaven about her own murder?” That’s a concept. “What if a fourteen-year-old girl cannot rest in heaven, and realizes that her family cannot rest on earth, because her murder remains unsolved, so she intervenes to help uncover the truth and bring peace to those who loved her, thus allowing her to move on?” That’s a premise, because of the hero’s quest it defines.

It isn’t enough that your character and your theme be compelling … you need to give your hero a motivated situation and an intriguing goal or problem to conquer.

## 2 - Character

The seven key areas of character illumination:

1. Surface affectations and personality — What the world sees and perceives about a character, including quirks, ticks, habits, and visual presentation. 
2. Backstory — All that happened in the character’s life before the story begins that conspires to make him who he is now. 
3. Character arc — How the character learns lessons and grows (changes) over the course of the story, how she evolves and conquers her most confounding issues. 
4. Inner demons and conflicts — The nature of the issues that hold a character back and define his outlook, beliefs, decisions, and actions. Fear of meeting new people, for example, is a demon that definitely compromises one’s life experience. 
5. Worldview — An adopted belief system and moral compass; the manifested outcome of backstory and inner demons. 
6. Goals and motivations — What drives a character’s decisions and actions, and the belief that the benefits of those decisions and actions outweigh any costs or compromises. 
7. Decisions, actions, and behaviors — The ultimate decisions and actions that are the sum of all of the above.

* The first dimension of character - surface traits, quirks, and habits.
    - This first dimension shows the way a character looks and acts … her hair, her make-up, the kind of car she drives, her wardrobe preferences, where she hangs out, her musical tastes, her taste in food, certain attitudes and prejudices, and so forth. It is largely a combination of two things: how she sees herself, and how she desires to be seen. Sometimes those factors contradict each other, which is, in itself, a product of the second dimension, which we’ll get to in a moment.
* The second dimension of character - backstory and inner demons.
* The third dimension of character - action, behavior, and worldview.

About **peripheral characters**: 
The best use of a peripheral character is to show the reader how a more important character relates to her or perceives her first-dimension efforts to brand herself.

About **backstory**:
The trick is to show just enough backstory that the reader can intuit where the character is coming from, rather than spelling it out. Flashback scenes solely for the purpose of explaining backstory are rarely a good idea. You should be more artful and subtle in delivering backstory as part of the narrative flow.

The two levels of **conflict** in every great story:
Every great story presents two levels of conflict for the reader’s pleasure: one, an external obstacle to the hero’s quest, and two, an internal demon that hinders the character’s ability to make the best possible decisions under pressure. An inner drive, weakness, belief system, or kink that makes him weak, that tempts, diverts, and seduces, that blinds him to the truth, that summons skewed values and warps his ability to see more clearly.

**Common inner demons** are cowardice, selfishness, addiction, fear, conceit, arrogance, hatred, resentment, bias, lack of confidence, stupidity, genius, heritage, poverty, ignorance, sociopathic insensitivity, naiveté, a spotty moral compass, sexual deviance … in general, any aspect of humanity that isn’t in line with the expectations of others or the accepted ground rules of success within the boundaries of your story and the rules you’ve created for it.

Examples of **character arc**: the meek become bold, the cowardly become courageous, the quiet become outspoken, the unforgiving decide to forgive, the resentful get over it, the clueless get a clue, the self-deceiving become self-aware, the dishonest come clean with themselves and others, the easily tempted become self-disciplined, the weak become strong, the unbelieving see the light, the oppressed get out from under the power of whatever oppresses them, victims become responsible for themselves, takers become givers, the insensitive develop a sensitivity chip, the naïve become fully aware, the bored become passionate, the cold become warm … the list is the very essence of the human experience.

**Character as structure**:

In her book The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live By, author Carol S. Pearson labels these four stages of character status as orphan, wanderer, warrior, and martyr. While I like all these labels, I don’t think the hero needs to die in the end; he just needs to be willing to.

1. Stage One Character Context
    - In the first part of your story, known as the setup, your hero is not yet fully exposed to the journey that you will unleash upon him. The antagonistic forces aren’t yet fully involved, if at all. We’re meeting your hero in his life before all this happens, seeing what he wants and what he does, and seeing who he is in all three dimensions... However this all shakes out, though, it can be said that here, in the first quarter of your story before the inciting First Plot Point arrives, your character is disconnected from his ultimate goal and destiny in some way. A curve ball, a change of course is right around the corner.
    - This is also where you first introduce backstory, which directly links to inner demons and the obvious first-dimension choices that compensate for them.
2. Stage Two Character Context
    - After the First Plot Point arrives to end the opening quartile (or slightly less) of your story, the hero faces a whole new or dramatically evolved set of problems, objectives, obstacles, and needs. A new quest. During this stage he is responding to this new situation, reacting to it, running from it, investigating it, challenging it, disbelieving it … but not really attacking the problem yet, at least in an informed manner. 
    - It could be said that the hero is exploring his options here, wandering. This is where he makes mistakes that teach him lessons about what he’s facing, what he must achieve, and what blocks his path. This is where his old patterns and inner demons—the starting point of his character arc—kick in to haunt and compromise his efforts. 
    - A huge mistake by newer writers is to have the hero begin to solve the problem at this point, rather than allow the antagonist to have his way with the hero. But it’s too early. The hero is still plagued and handicapped by his inner demons, in combination with not really understanding what he’s up against in terms of an antagonist force (that he may or may not be aware of at this point). This is where we see the hero flail and fail, and in doing so our empathy and emotions begin to build in his support.
3. Stage Three Character Context
    - After all this wandering around without much of a clue, flailing against a foe that’s bigger and better than him, that confuses and confounds him, it’s time to give our hero some hope. That’s the mission of this third stage: to empower the hero to attack the problem through the application of his learning curve, which requires a new willingness and ability to rise above his inner demons, possibly for the first time in his life.
    - In the second quartile of the story, the hero was responding; now here in the third quartile he gets aggressive and proactive. He attacks. It may not work as well as he hopes—in fact, it shouldn’t, not yet—but he’s not going to fail without a fight. The training wheels come off and the hero is doing unabashed battle with his obstacles, both interior and exterior.
4. Stage Four Character Context
    - As the song says, and then a hero comes along. And by hero, we’re not referring so much to the role being played, but the decisions and actions that allow the protagonist, and perhaps others, to become worthy of that title. 
    - Here in the concluding context of the fourth and final quartile of the book (which is Act Three in a screenplay), the hero is better equipped to square off with the antagonist and its inherent obstacles because he’s learned his lessons well. He’s changed, grown, evolved. He has courage where once he was cowardly. He engages where once he was isolated. He’s conquered inner demons that had tempted and haunted and filled him with doubt and dread, and now he’s prepared to apply that learning toward the implementation of heroic decisions and acts—even to the point of martyrdom—to save the day.

**The questions of character**
* What is your character’s backstory, the experiences that programmed how he thinks and feels and acts today? 
* What is his inner demon, and how does it influence decisions and actions in the face of the outer demon you are about to throw at him? 
* What does he resent? 
* What is his drive to get revenge? 
* How does he feel about himself, and what is the gap between that assessment and how others feel about him?
* What is your character’s worldview? 
* What is your character’s moral compass? 
* Is your character a giver or a taker in life? 
* To what extent does your character adhere to gender roles and stereotypes? And if he doesn’t fit cleanly into one, how is he different? 
* What lessons has your character not yet learned in life? 
* What lessons has he experienced but rejected or failed to learn? 
* Who are his friends? Are they like-for-like, or either above or below him in intelligence? 
* What is your character’s social I.Q.? Is he awkward? Eager? Easy? Life of the party? Wallflower? Totally faking it? 
* To what extent is your character either an introvert or an extrovert? How does this manifest in his life? 
* What is your character’s most secret yearning?
* What childhood dream never came true, and why? 
* What is your character’s religious or spiritual belief system? 
* What is the worst thing your character has ever done? 
* Does your character have secrets? Perhaps a secret life? 
* What does your character’s life partner, closest friends, and employer not know about him? 
* When, how, and why does he hold back, procrastinate? 
* What has held him back in life? 
* How many people would come to his funeral? Why might someone decide not to attend? 
* What is the most unlikely or the most contradictory aspect of your character? 
* What are your character’s first-dimension quirks, habits, and choices? 
* Why are they in evidence, what are they saying or covering for? 
* What is the backstory that leads to those choices?
* What are the psychological scars that affect your character’s life, and how does this link to backstory? 
* How strong is your character under pressure? 
* What is your character’s arc in your story? How does he change and grow over the course of the story? How does he apply that learning toward becoming the catalytic force that drives the denouement of the story?

## 3 - Theme

To put it in its most simple terms, theme is what our story means. How it relates to reality and life in general. What it says about life and the infinite roster of issues, facets, challenges, and experiences it presents. Theme can be a broad topical arena, or it can be a specific stance on anything human beings experience in life.

This was a pleasant read & a very short read that can be easily read in a sitting or two. I thought the first 50-60% of the novel was very good - I thoroughly enjoyed it and was easily engrossed in it. Alas, I found the last quarter of the book relatively weak hence the comparatively lower rating. If you're in the mood for a good, quick read to escape into, I definitely recommend it. But there's a ton of incredible literature out there & never enough time to read it so I find it hard to rate it much higher than I did.

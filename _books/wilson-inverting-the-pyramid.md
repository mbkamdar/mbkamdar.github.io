If you are a big fan of football and of football tactics (or at least very interested in it), then you know of this book already and you should read it if you haven't already. It's one of those "must read" introductions. It is much more a history (as the subtitle indicates) than a good introduction to the tactics themselves. The relatively low rating is because of my high expectations and I did not find the organization quite cohesive enough. Admittedly, it's not exactly an easy topic to categorize, but it still seemed a bit too jumbled a mess to me.

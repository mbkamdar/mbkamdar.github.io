> ...experience is algorithmically incompressible.

> Hassan lived the happiest of lives until he was overtaken by death, breaker of ties and destroyer of delights.

> Pretend that you have free will. It's essential that you behave as if your decisions matter, even though you know they don't. The reality isn't important; what's important is your belief, and believing the lie is the only way to avoid a waking coma. Civilization now depends on self-deception. Perhaps it always has.

> People are made of stories. Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we've lived; they're the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments.

Inclined to give a rating somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. 4 because it's just a joyful read. Relatively 'easy' to read and devour quickly, but with lots of small little ideas that are explored in interesting ways. But 3 because I didn't come away feeling like it 'changed my life' or anything like that, and the small little ideas that are explored aren't always sufficiently nuanced.

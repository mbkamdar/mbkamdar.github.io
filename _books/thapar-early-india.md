I'm torn between rating it 4 or 5 stars - if someone is very interested in this topic - ancient Indian history, I would definitely highly recommend this read. I like the structure that the author applies in this book: it's not simply a recitation of empire/kingdom one after the next, but it's more about discussing how the societies were at each relevant point in time (and why), how they evolved in response to various pressures, and how some of the typical stereotypes may not apply if you analyze the evidence, and the lack thereof, carefully. I appreciate that she considers not just the writings, and linguistic and archaeological evidence, but also that when you look so far back in time, you have to be careful about the lack of evidence too. There are likely to be strong biases in the writings that have survived. This book is pretty much a textbook, but it is a much more enjoyable read than that. It's a long read, full of relevant detail and evidence and discussion, but if you have the time & interest, it's truly a pleasurable read.

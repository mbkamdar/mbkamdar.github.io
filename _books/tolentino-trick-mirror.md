The book started off reasonably strongly but ultimately disappointing. Depends on your expectations though. If you're willing to think of this as a collection of middling essays from another issue of, say, The Atlantic or New York Magazine or something, then it's worth a skim - chances are you'll enjoy at least some of the essays.

Sample excerpt from the first essay on the Internet today:
> I've been thinking about five intersecting problems: first, how the internet is built to distend our sense of identity; second, how it encourages us to overvalue our opinions; third, how it maximizes our sense of opposition; fourth, how it cheapens our understanding of solidarity; and, finally, how it destroys our sense of scale.

> To communicate an identity requires some degree of self-delusion.

> In the absence of time to physically and politically engage with our community the way many of us want to, the internet provides a cheap substitute: it gives us brief moments of pleasure and connection, tied up in the opportunity to constantly listen and speak. Under these circumstances, opinion stops being a first step toward something and starts seeming like an end in itself.

> The internet was dramatically increasing our ability to know about things, while our ability to *change* things stayed the same, or possibly shrank right in front of us. I had started to feel that the internet would only ever induce this cycle of heartbreak and hardening â€“ a hyper-engagement that would make less sense every day.

A classic. Breezy read. What more is there to say.

A few quotes:

> 'The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.'

> The boy didn't know what to say. The old mand continued, "You have been a real blessing to me. Today, I understand something I didn't see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don't want anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I'm going to feel worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don't want to do so."

> ...the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired.

> "...the secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity."

> "My heart is afraud that it will have to suffer," the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.  
>  
> "Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity."

> "When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed."

Excellent, as usual from Tyler Cowen.  Please see [here for my book notes]({{ site.url }}/book-notes/cowen-the-complacent-class/).

> "The complacent class itself has ceased to believe in the regenerative properties of the world we all inhabit."
>
> "There is the distinct possibility that, in the next twenty years, we are going to find out far more about how the world really works than we ever wanted to know. As the mentality of the complacent class loses its grip, the subsequent changes in attitude will be part of an unavoidable and perhaps ultimately beneficial process of social, economic, and legal transformation. But many Americans will wish, every so desperately, to have that complacency back."

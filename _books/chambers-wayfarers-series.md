> "We cannot blame ourselves for the wars our parents start. Sometimes the very best thing we can do is walky away."

I've only read the first novel in the series so far - The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. I am tempted to give it 5 stars, but I've refrained from doing so on the (perhaps ill-advised) idea that 5 stars is for 'life changing' books. I can't claim this novel has changed my life, but it is an incredibly enjoyable read almost from first page to last. It was just so much fun. Reviews appear to frequently mention "feel-good science fiction" and "breezy television writing" and I can't exactly disgaree with such characterizations (though I mean these as a good thing). Highly recommended.

The death of a child about to feather, yes, that was sad. But a real tragedy was the loss of an adult with friends and lovers and family. The idea that a loss of *potential* was somehow worse than a loss of *achievement and knowledge* was something she had never been able to wrap her brain around.

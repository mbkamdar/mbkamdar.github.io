> "We cannot blame ourselves for the wars our parents start. Sometimes the very best thing we can do is walky away."

I've read the first two novels in the series so far - The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, and A Closed and Common Orbit - and am currently reading the third one in the series - Record of a Spaceborn Few. I am tempted to give it 5 stars, but I've refrained from doing so on the (perhaps ill-advised) idea that 5 stars is for 'life changing' books. 

I can't claim the first novel has changed my life, but it is an incredibly enjoyable read almost from first page to last. It was just so much fun. Reviews appear to frequently mention "feel-good science fiction" and "breezy television writing" and I can't exactly disgaree with such characterizations (though I mean these as a good thing). Highly recommended. A quote from the first one.

> She would never, ever understand the idea that a child, especially an *infant*, was of more value than an adult who had already gained all the skills needed to benefit the community.... The death of a child about to feather, yes, that was sad. But a real tragedy was the loss of an adult with friends and lovers and family. The idea that a loss of *potential* was somehow worse than a loss of *achievement and knowledge* was something she had never been able to wrap her brain around.

I didn't quite enjoy the second one as much - it felt a bit too preachy and faux philosophical, but the third one seems more a return to the style of the first so far. That said, I'd still recommend reading the second one for sure (but definitely start with the first - even though the second doesn't quite depend on knowing what happens in the first). An example quote from the second one.

> "I'm so scared. I've always been scared. And I'm so tired. I'm so tired of always being afraid. I just want - I just want to have people. I want somebody to make me dinner. I want a doctor to look at my leg and tell me to my face that it's okay. I want to be - I want to be like you. I want to live on Mars with a family and go on vacations. You - you both always - always said the galaxy was a wonderful place, but it's fucking not. It can't be, if it's got places like this one. If it's got people who make people like this." She pointed at her sun-scarred face, her bald head. "Do normal Humans know? Do they even know this planet is here? Do they know that any of this is going on? Because I'm going to die here." Saying the words out loud made her even more afraid, as if putting them out into the world would make them happen. But they were there now, and it was true, "I'm going to die here, and no - nobody will care."

Or another:
> "Life is terrifing. None of us have a rule book. None of us know what we're doing here. So, the easiest way to stare reality in the face and not utterly lose your shit is to believe that you have control over it. If you believe you have control, then you believe that you're at the top. And if you're at the top, then people who aren't like you... well, they've got to be somewhere lower, right? Every species does this. Does it again and again and again. Doesn't matter if they do it to themselves, or another species, or someone they created." She jutted her chin toward Tak. "You studied history. You know this. Everybody's history is one long slog of all the horrible shit we've done to each other."  
>  
> "It's not all that," Tak said. "A lot of it, yes. But there's good things, too. There's art and cities and science. All the things we've discovered. All the things we've learned and made better."  
>  
> "All the things made better for *some* people. Nobody has ever figured out how to make things better for *everybody*."

Wow, this novel is quite something else even as a reader of other Russian literature. The praise it gets as one of THE classics of the 20th century is well deserved. But to be honest, I wish I enjoyed it more. It was quite an interesting read, but I didn't quite find it as enjoyable as I thought I would. Hence the low honest rating from my side - it's likely a classic "it's not you, it's me" thing, but I am interested enough in wanting to read more Bulgakov.

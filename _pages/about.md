Interested in data-driven journalism, data science in general, and building apps for fun.

Other than this blog, please check out my [Github](https://github.com/mbkamdar/) for [my Projects](https://github.com/mbkamdar/).

I do not host comments on this site - spam, clutter, and all that.  But I would love to hear from you - you can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mkamdar) or via [email](mailto:mehul.k.public@gmail.com).

I love reading.  Hence the massive [Books section]({{ site.url }}/books).  Physics, tech, science fiction, philosophy, history, economics. My interests are broad... perhaps too broad, but I derive inspiration from [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/).

This site is created using the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
